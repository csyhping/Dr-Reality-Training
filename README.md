# Dr. Reality Training
A SteamVR and Unity project created during Aggie Invent AR/VR 2018, a 48-hour intensive design experience offered by Texas A&M - with this event being sponsored by Dell and Accenture. 

My team of 6 presented a virtual reality medical training simulation that was designed to assist in the lack of hands-on experience(practicals) opportunities in medical school curriculum. My teammate and I created a SteamVR and Unity proof-of-concept hospital environment and a simplified [Endotracheal intubation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheal_intubation) procedure.
